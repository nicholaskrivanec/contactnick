# ðŸ‘‹ Hello developer!

Introducing a sleek and intuitive contact form template built with Vue.js and powered by TypeScript. With its minimalistic design and user-friendly functionality, this template streamlines the process of gathering customer information and simplifying communication.

This project serves as an example of what can be achieved. It is not a fully functional product. Feel free to use the source code and ideas as a starting point for your own projects.

This is one of the many templates available from W3Schools.

## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

This template is made by using several technologies.  
Below are explanations about where to find specific code.

Public resources are found in the folder `public`.

Data is stored in your admin console.

### Root HTML

HTML files are stored in a folder called `views`. Files have `.vue` extension.
In the `client/index.html` you can add your external links and scripts, or change other general code that is relevant on every page like the head.
You can find other templates in `views/`.

### CSS and images

You can find the main CSS file in `client/src/assets/main.css`. Images can also be stored here, but you are free to set up your own file structure for assets. 

### Application

You can find the core frontend Vue application in `client`, with a folder for public resources, `src/`, and the main `index.html`.

### Backend

The backend work is in `server/`. 
API routes in `client/src/router/index.ts`.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   
Database creation, queries, and a database connection can be found in `server/db/index.js`.

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note
For now files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced. 

This template incorporates both a backend server router and a frontend application router. It is crucial to ensure that their endpoints remain unique and do not overlap.
